# MCW Package Format 
> This document was created with assistance from ChatGPT.
## Overview

The launcher uses its own package format:

```
.mcwpack
```

The package format is designed to:

- Share instances
- Backup instances
- Import instances between launchers
- Preserve metadata and runtime settings

Internally, a `.mcwpack` file is a standard ZIP archive with a custom extension.

# Directory Structure

Example:

```text
My Instance.mcwpack
│
├── package.json
├── instance.json
├── settings.json
├── mods/
├── resourcepacks/
├── shaderpacks/
├── config/
├── saves/
└── ...
```

---

# package.json

This file describes the package itself.

Example:

```json
{
    "format": "mcwpack",
    "format_version": 1,

    "package_type": "instance",

    "launcher_name": "MCW Launcher",
    "launcher_version": "0.2.3-alpha",

    "created_at": "...",

    "include_saves": false
}
```

## Fields

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| format | Package identifier |
| format_version | Package format version |
| package_type | Package type |
| launcher_name | Launcher that generated the package |
| launcher_version | Launcher version |
| created_at | Export time |
| include_saves | Whether world saves are included |

---

# instance.json

Contains metadata describing the instance.

Example:

```json
{
    "id": "...",
    "name": "...",
    "version_id": "1.21.8",
    "mod_loader": [
        "vanilla",
        "-1"
    ]
}
```

---

# settings.json

Contains runtime settings.

Example:

```json
{
    "java": {
        "path": "",
        "min_memory": 1024,
        "max_memory": 2048,
        "arguments": []
    },

    "window": {
        "width": 1280,
        "height": 720,
        "fullscreen": false
    },

    "launch": {
        "game_arguments": []
    }
}
```

---

# Validation

Before importing, the launcher validates:

- package.json exists
- instance.json exists
- format == "mcwpack"
- supported format_version
- supported package_type

Packages failing validation are rejected.

---

# Future Compatibility

Future versions may introduce additional package types.

Possible examples:

- Instance Package
- World Package
- Modpack Package
- Resource Pack Package

Older launchers should reject packages with unsupported format versions.

---

# Design Decisions

## ZIP-based format

`.mcwpack` is based on the ZIP archive format.

Advantages:

- No custom compression algorithm
- Easy debugging
- Widely supported
- Cross-platform

---

## Separation of Metadata

Package metadata is stored in:

```
package.json
```

Instance metadata is stored in:

```
instance.json
```

This separation allows package information and instance information to evolve independently.
